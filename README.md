# AIM: Artificial Intelligence for Multimediageneration - Student Workshop Materials

This repository contains the materials for the student workshop called AIM - "Artificial Intelligence for Multimedia Generation".
AIM aims to teach media, digital and AI literacy to students in a playful way. The workshop is designed for students aged 8-18 years and can be used in schools, libraries or other educational institutions. The workshop is designed to be held in 1-2 hours and can be adapted to the needs of the participants.

## Workshop modules

AIM consists of four major modules:

1. Text generation,
2. image and video generation,
3. music generation and
4. voice-cloning and text-to-speech (TTS) generation.

Each module consists of a theoretical part and a practical part. The theoretical part introduces the topic and explains the basics of the technology. The practical part consists of a hands-on tutorial, where the participants can try out the technology themselves.

## How to use?

The workshop materials are designed with Jupyter Notebooks. To run the models, the utilization of a GPU is advised. If no GPU is available locally, Google Colaboraty provides an easy way of running the models in the cloud, free of charge.
